# 🥦 Fruits & Vegetables Image Classification

This is a machine learning-based image classification project that identifies different types of fruits and vegetables using a trained deep learning model built with TensorFlow. The project also features a simple and interactive web interface powered by Streamlit.

## 🚀 Features

- Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Supports multiple categories (e.g., apple, banana, bell pepper, etc.)
- Streamlit-powered web app for real-time prediction
- User-friendly interface for uploading and classifying images
